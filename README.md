Tuition fees have grown dramatically faster than inflation. UBC researcher Lori McElroy found that students with little or no debt were more than twice as likely to finish their degree than students with high levels of debt. The completion rate for students with under $1000 of debt was 71 percent, while the completion rate for those with over $10,000 was 34 percent. So, it's a problem, and this script offers no solutions. It's just another little program to help me learn new techniques with python and data sets.
